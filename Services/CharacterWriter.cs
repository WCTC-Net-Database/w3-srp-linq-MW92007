/// CharacterWriter - Responsible for ONE thing: WRITING character data.

/// This class demonstrates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
/// - It ONLY writes character data to files
/// - It does NOT read data (that's CharacterReader's job)
/// - It does NOT handle the menu or user interaction
///
/// Why separate reading and writing?
/// - Different operations might need different file formats
/// - Writing might need validation that reading doesn't
/// - We can add features (like backup) without changing reading code
